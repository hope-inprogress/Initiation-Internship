## 🌐 About the Project

This is a **static clone** of the official website of the *Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Tunisiens (SNCFT)* — Tunisia’s national railway company.  
I built this project as part of my **first-year internship** (Stage d’Initiation), focusing on mastering web development fundamentals with pure **HTML** and **CSS**.

The goal: replicate the structure, layout, and feel of a real-world website using only front-end technologies.
