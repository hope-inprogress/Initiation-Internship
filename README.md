## üåü All Aboard the SNCFT Express!

Welcome to my **SNCFT Website Clone**, a project crafted during my first-year *Initiation Internship* (Stage d'Initiation). This project is a tribute to the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Chemins de Fer Tunisiens (SNCFT), Tunisia's national railway company. Built from scratch with **HTML** and **CSS**, it was my playground for mastering web development fundamentals while recreating the essence of SNCFT's online presence. Hop on board to explore this digital railway adventure!

## üé´ Project Overview

This project is a fully functional clone of the SNCFT website, designed to mirror its structure and style. It features three core pages: a welcoming **Home** page, an informative **Presentation** page, and a user-friendly **Contact** page. Through this internship project, I learned to weave semantic HTML with stylish CSS to create a cohesive, visually appealing multi-page website.

## üöÑ Features

- **Dynamic Navigation**: A sleek, responsive navigation bar with links to *Home*, *Presentation*, and *Contact*, plus social media icons for a modern touch.
- **Home Station**: A warm welcome with an introduction to SNCFT and a bold call-to-action button to explore more.
- **Presentation Junction**: A detailed showcase of SNCFT's mission, history, and maintenance efforts, complete with a secondary navigation menu for seamless section hopping.
- **Contact Depot**: A clean contact form for passengers (users) to send inquiries, styled with a professional yet approachable design.
- **Visual Timetable**: Custom CSS with a scenic background image, semi-transparent containers, and hover effects that bring the railway vibe to life.
- **External Connections**: Integrates Font Awesome for social media icons and uses SNCFT's official favicon for authenticity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The tracks that structure the website's content.
- **CSS3**: The paint and polish for layouts, colors, and interactive effects.
- **Font Awesome**: The signage for social media icons in the navigation bar.
